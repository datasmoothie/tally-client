# The API

The Python SDK API (which is a Python wrapper to the Tally API) allows users to both perform data processing tasks such as cleaning, weighting and creating new variables, and to build deliverables to clients.

The Two main aspects of the API is the DataSet and the Build. The DataSet object represents the data and meta-data in a survey is used for loading and converting data, saving to files, and all the data processing tasks.
