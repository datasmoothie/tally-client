# Terminology

#### Dichotomous variable
A dichotomous variable is one that has only two options, one meaning true and the other false (these can be denoted as 1/0, ""/"yes", "true"/"false" and so on).

An example of a non-dichotomous variable is one that has the likert scale, "

#### Likert scale
A typical Likert scale is Strongly disagree, Disagree, Neither agree nor disagree, Agree, Strongly agree.

#### NETs
The combination of several answers into one, such as "Strongly agree" and "Agree", is often called a NET. In Dejuice, NETs can be created by editing categorical variables.

#### NPS score
A scale from 0-10 rating how likely a user would be to recommend a service or business. NPS scores are stored as numerical variables and single-choice variables (sometimes the latter has to be created with Dejuice). The single-choice variable will have three categories, detractors (0-6), passives (7-8) and promoters (9-10), created from the numberical variable.

#### RIM weighting
RIM weighting (Random Iterative Method) is an algorithm commonly used to make sure a survey data sample accurately represents a given population. Dejuice supports RIM weighting with complex weighting schemas


#### Weighting schema
A weighting schema is a set of instructions on how to weight sample data to better represent a population. Common examples are schemas for weighting populations in specific countries, where the schema indicates what the true demographic looks like, e.g. that women and men are 51% and 49% of the population.
